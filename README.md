# Stores Transactions Manager

A simple software for managing transactions by uploading and parsing a CNAB file.

The Backend is built with NestJs, using Prisma ORM/(Postgres) as Database and the Frontend with Next.NestJs using MUI for UI components.

Ths repository has a minimal CI/CD setup via Github Actions, that automatically builds the application and deploys on Heroku.
